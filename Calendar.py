#Obtain the user input and try to display the Calender for that month
# Test case 1
# DO I need to create a function for this?
# No I don't ? why?
# Yes I do,why? It performs a task and wrapping it in a function will make my work cleaner and easier to debug
# The name of the function will be Calendar 
# It will take in three parameters
# Date (int), month(String), year(int)
# Does it return any statement? no it doesn't, there is no operation it's carrying out apart from recieving inputs from the user 
# let's go...#
def calendar(date, month,year):
    
    calendar(date=int(input("The day is :")),month=input("The month is : "),year= int(input("The year is")),)
print( calendar)
