#this is a very basic arithmetic operation practice
# the basic arithmetic operations we have perform addition, multiplication, subtraction, division
# what the computer does first before another operation follows our BODMAS
# we can assign values to a variable 
# e.g a= 10
# b= 8
# to carry out the addition operation: I print out the variables with the operator in between
# print(a +b)
# we can solve word problems or express our arithmetic problems the same way we solve real life problems
# Boolean Operators
# Boolean is a type of value in programming that can only be 'True' or 'False' 
# The == operator represemts equal to in programming
# the == operator compares two variables and checks whether they are equal
# Comparison operators
# Python has many types of comparison operators, including:
# < less than
# > greater than
# == equal
# >= greater or equal
# <=less or equal
#!= not equal#
# x = 36 / 4 * (3 + 2) * 4 + 2
# print(x)
y= 2*2**3
print(y)
# tup = (4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
# print(tup[8])
#tup = (4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
#tup[2] = 10
#print(tup[2])
t = (4, 4, 5, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6)
print(t.count(4))
